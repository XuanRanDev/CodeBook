CodeBook User Agreement

Preface

Welcome to CodeBook! We highly value your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal information. Please read this privacy agreement carefully before using our application to understand how we collect, use, and protect your information.

Information We Collect

1. Information You Provide
   When you use CodeBook, you may provide us with the following information:
   - Your usernames and passwords for other apps.

2. Automatically Collected Information
   We do not automatically collect any user-related personal information. All data is stored locally on your device unless you choose to export or share it.

Use of Information

We use your information only in the following situations:
- To help you manage and store your account and password information.
- To provide data encryption and decryption services to ensure your data is securely stored on your device.
- To facilitate data import and export, preventing the need to re-enter account passwords when migrating devices.

Sharing of Information

We will not share, sell, rent, or otherwise disclose your personal information to any third party.

Protection of Information

We take the security of your information very seriously. When you first use CodeBook, you will be required to select an encryption method to encrypt and decrypt the data you provide:

- Password Method
  You need to provide a password (hereinafter referred to as the password seed). CodeBook uses this password seed to generate a high-strength AES256 encryption key. This key is generated using the PBKDF2 encryption algorithm, iterating 10,000 times, ensuring that the encryption key generated from the password seed better protects your data. The key generated from the same password seed will be the same, so please ensure the complexity of the password when choosing this method.

- Fingerprint Method
  * We strongly recommend using the password method.
  If you choose the fingerprint method for encryption, your Android system must be Android 11 or above, with a screen lock password set and a fingerprint added. The fingerprint method may be disabled due to hardware damage or the deletion of the password/fingerprint in the system, causing data loss.

  When using the fingerprint method for encryption and decryption, CodeBook will require you to first authorize the fingerprint. Upon fingerprint authorization, CodeBook will generate an encryption key in your system's secure hardware. You may need to frequently authenticate with your fingerprint to allow CodeBook to request the encryption key from the operating system for encryption and decryption. If CodeBook is uninstalled or the operating system is reset, the encryption key stored in the secure hardware will be deleted and cannot be recovered.

Regardless of the method you choose, we recommend treating CodeBook as an offline, encrypted note-taking app and regularly backing up your data. CodeBook is not responsible for the leakage or loss of your data.

AES256 Encryption Algorithm: The AES256 encryption algorithm is a type of Advanced Encryption Standard, using a 256-bit key length for data encryption. It is currently one of the most popular and secure block encryption methods. In this algorithm, data is divided into multiple blocks, each independently encrypted with a 256-bit key, and then recombined to produce ciphertext.

* According to the current computational speed of home PCs, it would take at least a billion years to crack AES256 encrypted data. (Source: ChatGPT)

User Rights

You have the right to access, modify, or delete your personal information at any time. You can perform these actions through the relevant functions in the application.

Data Storage and Retention

All user data is stored on your local device. We do not store any personal information on our servers. Users can choose to export or delete their data.

- Export Data: You need to provide an encryption key. CodeBook will also provide you with the salt value used for this encryption. CodeBook will use this salt value and your given password to encrypt the data before exporting it to a TXT file. This file is also protected by AES256 encryption.

- Import Data: You need to provide the decryption password and salt value. CodeBook will attempt to decrypt the data before importing it. Incorrect passwords or salt values will result in import failure. Please ensure that you do not delete the original data in CodeBook until after a successful import.

Changes and Revisions

We may update this privacy agreement from time to time. Since CodeBook cannot connect to the internet to obtain the latest agreement, please visit the CodeBook GitHub repository to view the latest information.

Regardless of time, place, or circumstances, the user agreement shall always be based on the latest version in the official CodeBook GitHub repository, and the final interpretation right belongs to the developer.

Final Reminder

CodeBook is for learning, communication, and testing purposes only. We are not responsible for the loss or leakage of user data. As an open-source program, anyone can access the source code and attack CodeBook. When using CodeBook, please ensure that you download it from the official CodeBook GitHub page.

Unknown sources of CodeBook may contain malicious behavior. To prevent targeted attacks by malicious programs, the CodeBook Release version will enable code obfuscation protection. If you mind, please fork the source code and compile it yourself.
